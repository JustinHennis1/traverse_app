This area is country quiet and easily accessible to downtown Newark, Newark airport, major malls + box stores within minutes, Walmart, Whole Foods, Trader Joes, and more. NYC very close.

I'm originally from Costa Rica.   My Grand parents moved from Jamaica to  Limon, Costa Rica to work on building a railroad  to San Jose 100 years ago.
Limon and Costa Rica are very friendly places.  So, is Irvington, NJ, USA.

We change codes after each guest leaves.

I'm originally from Costa Rica.   My Grand parents moved from Jamaica to  Limon, Costa Rica to work on building a railroad  to San Jose 100 years ago.
Limon and Costa Rica are very friendly places.  So, is Irvington, NJ, USA.

I'm originally from Costa Rica.   My Grand parents moved from Jamaica to  Limon, Costa Rica to work on building a railroad  to San Jose 100 years ago.
Limon and Costa Rica are very friendly places.  So, is Irvington, NJ, USA.

By day I am a licensed realtor and by night I am a Bob Dylan fanatic.

I enjoy health & fitness, reading and writing, music & the arts, and spending the day on the beach.

Hope to see you soon!",within an hour,100%,100%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-403995401/original/5fbfad69-38f8-48fb-8011-a0b4cc00aa34.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-403995401/original/5fbfad69-38f8-48fb-8011-a0b4cc00aa34.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Mount Pleasant/Lower Broadway,6,6,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,East,,40.73514,-74.13921,Entire home,Entire home/apt,10,,2.5 baths,,5,[],$250.00,1,60,2,3,1125,1125,2.9,1125.0,,t,0,0,0,89,2023-12-31,57,53,4,2022-12-04,2023-12-22,4.61,4.67,4.47,4.82,4.84,4.21,4.51,,f,4,4,0,0,4.35

I'm a proud New Yorker who has had the privilege of being shaped by the rich cultural tapestry that my heritage offers. My parents come from Egypt and the Dominican Republic, two countries with distinct cultures that have come together in a beautiful fusion.

Growing up in New York, I was exposed to a myriad of cultures, languages, and traditions. From the festivals and parades of the Caribbean and Latin America to the art and music of West Africa and South Asia, New York provided a glimpse into the world without ever leaving the city limits.

My Egyptian culture is deeply rooted in history, art, and religion. From the Pyramids of Giza to the cuisine with fragrant spices, herbs, and hearty dishes such as koshari, ful medames, and molokhia. Family is at the center of Egyptian culture, and gatherings are often filled with music, storytelling, and lively conversations.

The Dominican Republic, on the other hand, is known for its vibrant music, dance, and joyful celebrations. Merengue and bachata are a reflection of our spirit of rhythm and passion. The cuisine is a fusion of African, Spanish, and indigenous influences, with dishes such as mangu, sancocho, and chicharrón.

Growing up with these two rich cultures has given me a unique perspective on the world and a deep appreciation for diversity. I've been fortunate to experience the beauty of both Egyptian and Dominican cultures firsthand, from the traditional dances and music to the delicious cuisine and warm hospitality. These cultural influences, combined with the diversity of New York, have inspired me to explore other cultures and learn about their traditions and customs.

As I continue to travel and explore the world, I carry with me the richness and diversity of my heritage and the vibrancy of New York. I'm proud to share my cultural background with others, and I'm grateful for the opportunities that I've had to learn, grow, and connect with people from all over the world.",within an hour,100%,100%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-21500972/original/9738a59b-03fa-4bda-8a7d-f6d5e00322b9.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-21500972/original/9738a59b-03fa-4bda-8a7d-f6d5e00322b9.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Fordham Heights,8,8,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t,"Newark, New Jersey, United States",Central,,40.7441851,-74.1842025,Private room in rental unit,Private room,1,,1 shared bath,,1,[],$30.00,30,365,30,30,1125,1125,30.0,1125.0,,t,2,2,11,285,2024-01-01,3,3,0,2023-07-08,2023-10-09,5.0,4.67,5.0,4.67,5.0,5.0,5.0,,f,5,0,5,0,0.51

I'm a proud New Yorker who has had the privilege of being shaped by the rich cultural tapestry that my heritage offers. My parents come from Egypt and the Dominican Republic, two countries with distinct cultures that have come together in a beautiful fusion.

Growing up in New York, I was exposed to a myriad of cultures, languages, and traditions. From the festivals and parades of the Caribbean and Latin America to the art and music of West Africa and South Asia, New York provided a glimpse into the world without ever leaving the city limits.

My Egyptian culture is deeply rooted in history, art, and religion. From the Pyramids of Giza to the cuisine with fragrant spices, herbs, and hearty dishes such as koshari, ful medames, and molokhia. Family is at the center of Egyptian culture, and gatherings are often filled with music, storytelling, and lively conversations.

The Dominican Republic, on the other hand, is known for its vibrant music, dance, and joyful celebrations. Merengue and bachata are a reflection of our spirit of rhythm and passion. The cuisine is a fusion of African, Spanish, and indigenous influences, with dishes such as mangu, sancocho, and chicharrón.

Growing up with these two rich cultures has given me a unique perspective on the world and a deep appreciation for diversity. I've been fortunate to experience the beauty of both Egyptian and Dominican cultures firsthand, from the traditional dances and music to the delicious cuisine and warm hospitality. These cultural influences, combined with the diversity of New York, have inspired me to explore other cultures and learn about their traditions and customs.

As I continue to travel and explore the world, I carry with me the richness and diversity of my heritage and the vibrancy of New York.

I'm a proud New Yorker who has had the privilege of being shaped by the rich cultural tapestry that my heritage offers. My parents come from Egypt and the Dominican Republic, two countries with distinct cultures that have come together in a beautiful fusion.

Growing up in New York, I was exposed to a myriad of cultures, languages, and traditions. From the festivals and parades of the Caribbean and Latin America to the art and music of West Africa and South Asia, New York provided a glimpse into the world without ever leaving the city limits.

My Egyptian culture is deeply rooted in history, art, and religion. From the Pyramids of Giza to the cuisine with fragrant spices, herbs, and hearty dishes such as koshari, ful medames, and molokhia. Family is at the center of Egyptian culture, and gatherings are often filled with music, storytelling, and lively conversations.

The Dominican Republic, on the other hand, is known for its vibrant music, dance, and joyful celebrations. Merengue and bachata are a reflection of our spirit of rhythm and passion. The cuisine is a fusion of African, Spanish, and indigenous influences, with dishes such as mangu, sancocho, and chicharrón.

Growing up with these two rich cultures has given me a unique perspective on the world and a deep appreciation for diversity. I've been fortunate to experience the beauty of both Egyptian and Dominican cultures firsthand, from the traditional dances and music to the delicious cuisine and warm hospitality. These cultural influences, combined with the diversity of New York, have inspired me to explore other cultures and learn about their traditions and customs.

I'm a proud New Yorker who has had the privilege of being shaped by the rich cultural tapestry that my heritage offers. My parents come from Egypt and the Dominican Republic, two countries with distinct cultures that have come together in a beautiful fusion.

Growing up in New York, I was exposed to a myriad of cultures, languages, and traditions. From the festivals and parades of the Caribbean and Latin America to the art and music of West Africa and South Asia, New York provided a glimpse into the world without ever leaving the city limits.

My Egyptian culture is deeply rooted in history, art, and religion. From the Pyramids of Giza to the cuisine with fragrant spices, herbs, and hearty dishes such as koshari, ful medames, and molokhia. Family is at the center of Egyptian culture, and gatherings are often filled with music, storytelling, and lively conversations.

The Dominican Republic, on the other hand, is known for its vibrant music, dance, and joyful celebrations. Merengue and bachata are a reflection of our spirit of rhythm and passion. The cuisine is a fusion of African, Spanish, and indigenous influences, with dishes such as mangu, sancocho, and chicharrón.

Growing up with these two rich cultures has given me a unique perspective on the world and a deep appreciation for diversity. I've been fortunate to experience the beauty of both Egyptian and Dominican cultures firsthand, from the traditional dances and music to the delicious cuisine and warm hospitality. These cultural influences, combined with the diversity of New York, have inspired me to explore other cultures and learn about their traditions and customs.

As I continue to travel and explore the world, I carry with me the richness and diversity of my heritage and the vibrancy of New York. I'm proud to share my cultural background with others, and I'm grateful for the opportunities that I've had to learn, grow, and connect with people from all over the world.",within an hour,100%,100%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-21500972/original/9738a59b-03fa-4bda-8a7d-f6d5e00322b9.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-21500972/original/9738a59b-03fa-4bda-8a7d-f6d5e00322b9.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Fordham Heights,8,8,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t,"Newark, New Jersey, United States",Central,,40.74467,-74.18396,Private room in rental unit,Private room,2,,1 shared bath,,1,[],$40.00,28,365,28,28,1125,1125,28.0,1125.0,,t,13,13,21,296,2024-01-01,2,2,0,2023-08-11,2023-09-19,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.5,5.0,,f,5,0,5,0,0.42

A little about me, I am a mechanical engineer who loves to explore new places, try new foods, and meet new people. Hospitality is a hobby of mine, and I enjoy making others feel at home in their travel adventures. My experience in construction management has also allowed me to attend to guests unforeseen concerns which I can handle in a timely manner to ensure guests receive the best experience possible. I love meeting new people and providing them with a comfortable and memorable experience during their stay. Whether you're here for a short-term or long-term stay, I'm here to make sure you feel right at home.

When I'm not working, you can find me on the soccer field or immersing myself in a good video game. I'm also an avid reader, so feel free to ask me about any great books you've been meaning to read. And, of course, spending time with my family is a top priority for me.

Being born and raised in New York, I know this city inside and out. So, whether you're looking for the best slice of pizza or the trendiest bar in town, I can answer any questions you may have.
