I enjoy winter skiing,  summer hiking , road trips or river trips, music, reading and favorite small children.  History, gardening, poetry and literature, food, agriculture are some of my interests.  Turkey, Greece, Ukraine, Mexico, Switzerland and France are places I've settled in for several weeks at a time.  In fact, staying in one place while exploring all around suits me better than continuous travel, and that's the experience I'd like to enable as a host.  Salem itself has much to offer besides options for scenic day trips: to the Pacific, to wineries of all sorts, cities north and south (Portland and Eugene), the Columbia Gorge and Mt Hood, waterfalls and forests, art galleries and museums.
One of my strengths is connecting folks with resources and opportunities.  At work, that's been my focus in helping newcomers with cultural adjustment.  Helping guests get the most from their time here appeals to me.  I also value independence and privacy, so knowing what guests prefer can make a good stay for us both.

Most recently, I have enjoyed “packing down” my bike with gear and heading down the road - for an overnight, or three, or three weeks.  This gives a whole new meaning to “bed and breakfast”.

When I’m not cycling, I’m usually busy cooking, cleaning, reading, sewing or watching the trees and flowers grow in my little forest; and, of course, accommodating the many fascinating guests who find their way to Century House from all corners of the globe.  My life is truly enriched by the diversity of perspectives and experiences that guests bring with them.

I confess, my favorite guests may be the children. With a full career of working in the field of early childhood, I never cease to be wowed by the uninhibited enthusiasm, curiosity, and resilience of the younger generation.  I am thrilled and dedicated to being a family-friendly business.

Another of my endeavors is the promotion/education of good nutrition.  I might be seen pedaling to a local farm to fill my packs with broccoli for the local food bank  - or, with fresh kale for a morning smoothie :-).  Don’t worry, there is still room for a brownie or an oatmeal cookie on the dessert tray.  After all, we need our dark chocolate, and our oatmeal, right?

Most recently, I have enjoyed “packing down” my bike with gear and heading down the road - for an overnight, or three, or three weeks.  This gives a whole new meaning to “bed and breakfast”.

When I’m not cycling, I’m usually busy cooking, cleaning, reading, sewing or watching the trees and flowers grow in my little forest; and, of course, accommodating the many fascinating guests who find their way to Century House from all corners of the globe.  My life is truly enriched by the diversity of perspectives and experiences that guests bring with them.

I confess, my favorite guests may be the children. With a full career of working in the field of early childhood, I never cease to be wowed by the uninhibited enthusiasm, curiosity, and resilience of the younger generation.  I am thrilled and dedicated to being a family-friendly business.

Another of my endeavors is the promotion/education of good nutrition.  I might be seen pedaling to a local farm to fill my packs with broccoli for the local food bank  - or, with fresh kale for a morning smoothie :-).  Don’t worry, there is still room for a brownie or an oatmeal cookie on the dessert tray.  After all, we need our dark chocolate, and our oatmeal, right?

Texas in 2013 and headed north to the Portland, Oregon area where 2 of our children were living. We became enamored with the smaller city of Salem, Oregon and chose it as our next home allowing us to be closer to our children and my parents. 
My husband, Earl, and I both love to cook and I have a baked goods business out of our home.
Earl is a coffee perfectionist and our guests always get a fresh ground, fresh aero press cup of coffee as early as they need it.
Before moving to Texas in 1990 we lived in Homer, Alaska on the Kenai Peninsula for 20 years. Earl worked on the North Slope at Prudhoe Bay and was on the original crew that sent the first oil down the Alaska pipeline in 1978. 
Earl had always wanted to farm so off we went to Texas to raise beef cattle, soybeans and wheat. 
We love to travel and have enjoyed several road trips between Texas and Oregon! 
We love hosting and having the opportunity to meet so many different personalities and learn about different parts of our world and how we all fit together in it. We have the same attitude toward staying as guests. Airbnb is the perfect ambassador for our world.
We love the Airbnb adventure and we invite you to be a part of it!

Most recently, I have enjoyed “packing down” my bike with gear and heading down the road - for an overnight, or three, or three weeks.  This gives a whole new meaning to “bed and breakfast”.

When I’m not cycling, I’m usually busy cooking, cleaning, reading, sewing or watching the trees and flowers grow in my little forest; and, of course, accommodating the many fascinating guests who find their way to Century House from all corners of the globe.  My life is truly enriched by the diversity of perspectives and experiences that guests bring with them.

I confess, my favorite guests may be the children. With a full career of working in the field of early childhood, I never cease to be wowed by the uninhibited enthusiasm, curiosity, and resilience of the younger generation.  I am thrilled and dedicated to being a family-friendly business.

Another of my endeavors is the promotion/education of good nutrition.  I might be seen pedaling to a local farm to fill my packs with broccoli for the local food bank  - or, with fresh kale for a morning smoothie :-).  Don’t worry, there is still room for a brownie or an oatmeal cookie on the dessert tray.  After all, we need our dark chocolate, and our oatmeal, right?
