I am a film maker and lead a small team.  Fun, Respectful,  Mature, Quiet and love the Golden State Warriors.  I've lived in Berkeley, CA all my life.  Was born at Herrick Hospital in Berkeley and also attended Berkeley High.  I have 3 degrees including an MBA and 12 cyber security certifications.

I love hosting.  It's the people I meet.  Whether it's a business function where I host dozens of guests for cocktails and dinner or hosting for you, you can expect extreme humility and a keen sense admiration.  I know what it's like to travel and I know the feeling when your finally home.  I'll do my best to make sure you feel like you've never left home...: Enjoy Buckingham.  It's a real treat.  

I work remotely from home, and absolutely love the convenience.  I visit Peet's Coffee daily and once in a while I spoil myself to a massage at the Claremont Hotel.  I'm well traveled and some of my favorite destinations have been Ireland, Vienna, Alberta, Beirut, Sydney and the Daintree Rainforest near Cains.  

As your host, you will be treated with grace and dignity and hopefully a stash of Rip Van Waffles, if they are not gone by the time you arrive.  Fiji Bottled Water is always available in your room or in the fridge.

I travel solo, and sometimes off the grid. My favorite Airbnb was in Jakarta, where I met a fantastic family who are now friends.  Sometimes I travel with a backpack and on the cheap. Here at home, I like a soft bed and good sheets.

Also highly inspired by the illustrations on the Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime tea box (the ones with the bears in a very cozy and sweet-looking cottage-y home).

Ideally we would like to have whoever else stays here respect the dear and  precious (to us) objects in our home and appreciate it's warm and whimsical atmosphere.

Along with baking, I love the outdoors and am most happy when I am hiking and even happier the rare times I manage to pitch a tent somewhere beautiful; like Yosemite National Park.

I love to hike, throw a football, and watch the sun set. I garden on sunny days and cook when I'm inspired.

We love the outdoors - hiking, skiing, biking - so can point you to the best places to get outside and see big trees, gorgeous coastline, and spectacular mountains just outside of our favorite place, the San Francisco Bay area. 

We've been in Oakland for 8 years after living in San Francisco for 7 years. Rockridge is a great neighborhood full of delicious restaurants and small businesses. When we're not in the city or playing in the mountains or cooking healthy food, we are traveling around the world, usually staying in Airbnbs - from Spain to Oregon and the central CA coast! We are big travelers - recent trips have been to Alaska, Brazil, Italy, Hawaii, and many local California trips. We are also cooks and foodies - so hopefully you'll get to join us for a meal or some culinary adventure in our kitchen, or we'll give you great tips on the best food spots in the Bay Area.

Send me a message and let's see what we can find closest to your work that meets your needs.

I LOVE the San Francisco Bay Area, and I want you to also! I've lived here for over a decade, and there may be no other place in the world that offers the mix of opportunity, great weather, beautiful nature, urban activities, events, concerts, sporting events, and all kinds of great people.

I'll provide you my own local guide of activities, meetups for your personal interests, and do my best to enjoying your time in the Bay, being productive, staying active, and making the most of your time here (or you're welcome to relax.. we're just here when you need us.)

I have personally stayed in over 25 different Airbnb apartments around the US and the world, so I also know a thing or two about what makes a great furnished home and host. And will do my best to provide that to you. 

A little more about me personally: I've lived in California my whole life, and graduated from San Francisco State University, with a major in Economics and minor in Finance. I've lived all over the Bay Area, including most of the homes I host on Airbnb. I used to work for the State of California in bank regulation, before providing furnished homes and great stays to my guests full-time. 

I enjoy learning and sharing with other Airbnb hosts and real estate investors. In my free time, I also enjoy water color painting, karaoke, beaches, traveling, and making people happy :) 

I realize the San Francisco Bay Area gets very busy and can be quite pricey relative to other locations, so please send me a message so I can see what affordable home we can get you, before everything gets booked up. Thank you for your time.

I travel generally off the beaten track, usually with an adventure in mind - biking, rafting, hiking, camping, guiding tours in Latin America, curating art exhibits, studying art or languages, developing programs.  

My daughter and I have hosted many friends, foreign exchange students, and friends of friends over the years in Oakland.  I speak Spanish and some Portuguese (and English!).

 We love the convenient walking distance to Temescal and Rockridge restaurants, farmers’ markets, monthly First Fridays - music and arts events, shops, bookstores, galleries, and transportation to San Francisco. SF is a 20 minute train ride away. A great place to stay in the Bay Area and be our guest!

Things most important to me are friends, family, nature time, swimming, and learning.

About Lauren: I enjoy our 1913 Edwardian home here in Oakland. I love working with my hands, always making something or fixing something else.  So, you could see me futzing around the place with tools or a brush. I enjoy hiking in our beautiful East Bay regional parks (and beyond.) And, baby – I can cook!!

I also enjoy the peace and solitude of our lovely little garden and you can find me and Dolores having coffee on the deck in the morning sun.  Professionally, I'm the Artists' Services Manager of the Merola Opera Program, contracted with San Francisco Opera.

About Dolores: I received my PhD in Film Studies at UC Berkeley and currently teach online. My area of focus is ""divas"" (for real!), and enjoy a good cocktail, good conversation, and all the films of Catherine Deneuve.

I'm also honored to have over 250 great reviews on Airbnb. While we accept shorter reservations, we specialize in providing furnished homes for 1-12 months, and have noticed many of our customers are business travelers and travel nurses. And we know what they want!

Safe homes with amenities and transportation nearby, close to work, good office chair & desk for working at home, easy check-in without coordinating schedules, large WiFi connected TV's with Netflix to relax, personalized recommendations to meet like-minded folks, access to outdoor and fitness areas... and plenty more. As a former employee traveling for work in the finance industry, I realized that staying in hotels for long periods wasn't all it was chalked up to be... and that I could help provide a better experience for other travelers also. 

I've hosted hundreds of guests from around the US and world, and have studios to 2 bedroom apartments around the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley: 
- Mountain View
- San Jose
- Redwood City
- Oakland (quick commute to San Francisco)
- Richmond

Send me a message and let's see what we can find closest to your work that meets your needs.

I LOVE the San Francisco Bay Area, and I want you to also! I've lived here for over a decade, and there may be no other place in the world that offers the mix of opportunity, great weather, beautiful nature, urban activities, events, concerts, sporting events, and all kinds of great people.

I'll provide you my own local guide of activities, meetups for your personal interests, and do my best to enjoying your time in the Bay, being productive, staying active, and making the most of your time here (or you're welcome to relax.. we're just here when you need us.)

I have personally stayed in over 25 different Airbnb apartments around the US and the world, so I also know a thing or two about what makes a great furnished home and host. And will do my best to provide that to you. 

A little more about me personally: I've lived in California my whole life, and graduated from San Francisco State University, with a major in Economics and minor in Finance. I've lived all over the Bay Area, including most of the homes I host on Airbnb. I used to work for the State of California in bank regulation, before providing furnished homes and great stays to my guests full-time. 

I enjoy learning and sharing with other Airbnb hosts and real estate investors. In my free time, I also enjoy water color painting, karaoke, beaches, traveling, and making people happy :) 

I realize the San Francisco Bay Area gets very busy and can be quite pricey relative to other locations, so please send me a message so I can see what affordable home we can get you, before everything gets booked up. Thank you for your time.

We have truly enjoyed creating a space that is welcoming and comfortable for our guests. We love hosting on Airbnb and have had some wonderful experiences as Airbnb guests - most recently during trips to Tulum, Montreal, Spain & Morocco. 

Our guest suite is a private, indoor-outdoor space that is separated from the main house by a deck.  We simplified the guest spaces to make it possible to follow cleaning and sanitizing best practices during this time. The spaces are now more minimal but still feel cozy. 

We were students at UC Berkley and lived in San Francisco (and got married & had a baby) before moving to this special spot. We appreciate the wonderful diversity of people, food, art & nature found in Oakland and having been in the Bay Area for many years, we know it well.  We are more than happy to make recommendations for local restaurants, bookstores, shops, classes, hiking trails...looking for something else? We could probably make a recommendation for that too. :)

We are available if anything comes up and the separation between the main house and cottage provides our guests with space and privacy.

I’m a Bay Area Native (grew up in Palo Alto, lived in San Francisco) and have been 'on the sunny side of the bay' for the past 16 years. I have to say -- it's the best! I find that it provides the perfect combination of natural beauty (hiking and biking in nearby redwood forests), warm/sunny weather, bike and walk-friendly boulevards, historic homes, and easy access to diverse restaurants, urban sites/interests in downtown Berkeley (blocks away) and nearby Oakland and San Francisco.

I'm a long-time fan of Airbnb having hosted lovely guests in my former Glenview bungalow (I hope the reviews still show up!) and staying with awesome hosts while traveling. This is the first time hosting our new Berkeley home. We're excited to meet you and make your stay here a perfect one!

I'm also honored to have over 250 great reviews on Airbnb. While we accept shorter reservations, we specialize in providing furnished homes for 1-12 months, and have noticed many of our customers are business travelers and travel nurses. And we know what they want!

Safe homes with amenities and transportation nearby, close to work, good office chair & desk for working at home, easy check-in without coordinating schedules, large WiFi connected TV's with Netflix to relax, personalized recommendations to meet like-minded folks, access to outdoor and fitness areas... and plenty more. As a former employee traveling for work in the finance industry, I realized that staying in hotels for long periods wasn't all it was chalked up to be... and that I could help provide a better experience for other travelers also. 

I've hosted hundreds of guests from around the US and world, and have studios to 2 bedroom apartments around the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley: 
- Mountain View
- San Jose
- Redwood City
- Oakland (quick commute to San Francisco)
- Richmond

Send me a message and let's see what we can find closest to your work that meets your needs.

I LOVE the San Francisco Bay Area, and I want you to also! I've lived here for over a decade, and there may be no other place in the world that offers the mix of opportunity, great weather, beautiful nature, urban activities, events, concerts, sporting events, and all kinds of great people.

I'll provide you my own local guide of activities, meetups for your personal interests, and do my best to enjoying your time in the Bay, being productive, staying active, and making the most of your time here (or you're welcome to relax.. we're just here when you need us.)

I have personally stayed in over 25 different Airbnb apartments around the US and the world, so I also know a thing or two about what makes a great furnished home and host. And will do my best to provide that to you. 

A little more about me personally: I've lived in California my whole life, and graduated from San Francisco State University, with a major in Economics and minor in Finance. I've lived all over the Bay Area, including most of the homes I host on Airbnb. I used to work for the State of California in bank regulation, before providing furnished homes and great stays to my guests full-time. 

I enjoy learning and sharing with other Airbnb hosts and real estate investors. In my free time, I also enjoy water color painting, karaoke, beaches, traveling, and making people happy :) 

I realize the San Francisco Bay Area gets very busy and can be quite pricey relative to other locations, so please send me a message so I can see what affordable home we can get you, before everything gets booked up.

I'm also honored to have over 250 great reviews on Airbnb. While we accept shorter reservations, we specialize in providing furnished homes for 1-12 months, and have noticed many of our customers are business travelers and travel nurses. And we know what they want!

Safe homes with amenities and transportation nearby, close to work, good office chair & desk for working at home, easy check-in without coordinating schedules, large WiFi connected TV's with Netflix to relax, personalized recommendations to meet like-minded folks, access to outdoor and fitness areas... and plenty more. As a former employee traveling for work in the finance industry, I realized that staying in hotels for long periods wasn't all it was chalked up to be... and that I could help provide a better experience for other travelers also. 

I've hosted hundreds of guests from around the US and world, and have studios to 2 bedroom apartments around the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley: 
- Mountain View
- San Jose
- Redwood City
- Oakland (quick commute to San Francisco)
- Richmond

Send me a message and let's see what we can find closest to your work that meets your needs.

I LOVE the San Francisco Bay Area, and I want you to also! I've lived here for over a decade, and there may be no other place in the world that offers the mix of opportunity, great weather, beautiful nature, urban activities, events, concerts, sporting events, and all kinds of great people.

I'll provide you my own local guide of activities, meetups for your personal interests, and do my best to enjoying your time in the Bay, being productive, staying active, and making the most of your time here (or you're welcome to relax.. we're just here when you need us.)

I have personally stayed in over 25 different Airbnb apartments around the US and the world, so I also know a thing or two about what makes a great furnished home and host. And will do my best to provide that to you. 

A little more about me personally: I've lived in California my whole life, and graduated from San Francisco State University, with a major in Economics and minor in Finance. I've lived all over the Bay Area, including most of the homes I host on Airbnb. I used to work for the State of California in bank regulation, before providing furnished homes and great stays to my guests full-time. 

I enjoy learning and sharing with other Airbnb hosts and real estate investors. In my free time, I also enjoy water color painting, karaoke, beaches, traveling, and making people happy :) 

I realize the San Francisco Bay Area gets very busy and can be quite pricey relative to other locations, so please send me a message so I can see what affordable home we can get you, before everything gets booked up. Thank you for your time.

We have many neighbors, some you'll never see and others that hang out in front of their homes. They're all nice so a little smile and hi go a long way. You'll encounter all sorts of things on the street; hipsters, yupsters, regular Joe's, homeless people, and trash/debris. In other words having STREET SMARTS and being comfortable with diversity are highly recommended. We're often asked about safety when booking or staying in Oakland, and it's not really a question we can answer for you since it's highly subjective.

My love of baking began when I was just 4 years old and spent much of my time at my mother's side while she worked in The Vienna Bakery of Tempe, AZ.  Little did I know I would move from art and dance to baking as my life's work. 

Along with baking, I love the outdoors and am most happy when I am hiking and even happier the rare times I manage to pitch a tent somewhere beautiful; like Yosemite National Park.  My musical taste is all over the map. From straight up jazz to 60's and 70's rock to music from all over the world.

I have one daughter who has given me three super charged grandchildren, whom I just adore!  You may meet them during your stay with me.

I look forward to meeting all of you who choose to visit my home.  You will find it to be very comfortable and peaceful.  Some guests have even described it as ""magical.""

We shared a dream of retiring in Hawaii, and how awesome it would be to take our daughters on vacation there every summer. So, we found a home that needed some TLC. In a macadamia nutshell, our dream became a reality when we purchased our Hawaii home in 2015. This could not be possible if it wasn’t for God’s goodness all the time in our life. Therefore, to share in our lifelong dream, we invite you to come and enjoy your stay in our “Laule’a Ohana Hale” (peaceful family home) on the Big Island of Hawaii. Also, if you happen to need a place to stay in the East Bay (Northern Cali), we got a cozy studio, “Piedmont Pines Cottage” for you.

One of my greatest passions is traveling.  I love visiting new cities and countries. 
 Learning new languages and meeting new people.  And as a former Naval Officer, I've had the opportunity to live and travel to several countries.  Including traversing much of our world's oceans and almost all of the 50 US states and it's territories.  

Some of the countries  I've been to include:  Singapore, Malaysia, UAE, Thailand, Australia, Mexico, Canada, Iceland, Oman, England, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland, Brazil, etc.

 So as a frequent traveler I know exactly what's important when staying away from home.  Therefore, as a host, my mission is to facilitate you with a beautiful, clean, comfortable ""home away from home"" as well as offer you the best service, so that you enjoy your stay to the fullest.

I'm not one for talking about myself BUT I guess this would be a pretty valid excuse. :-)
In regards to being a guest in someone's home let me start off by saying that i am always respectful of other people and their belongings. As a guest in your home I would respectfully treat your space as I would my own (That's a good thing - I promise). I am appreciative of the opportunity to stay in someone's home and to see foreign cities from a local perspective. I'm a non smoker but I don't mind being in the company of people who smoke. 

A little more about me...
I've taken a few trips across the western hemisphere... visiting Toronto, Belize, Jamaica, Mexico, and Costa Rica. I haven't done much traveling in the past three years because I have 2 year old twins, enough said. :-)
Places I'd like to visit.. Spain, Morocco, Italy, Japan, Australia and New Zealand to name a few.
My idea of a good time while on vacation would be hanging out with locals or fellow travelers at a bar or cafe. I truly feel that life is about the relationships that you build along the way. 

In a nutshell I'm a product of my environment, a cool, laid-back, California kid from the San Francisco Bay Area.

I'm also honored to have over 250 great reviews on Airbnb. While we accept shorter reservations, we specialize in providing furnished homes for 1-12 months, and have noticed many of our customers are business travelers and travel nurses. And we know what they want!

Safe homes with amenities and transportation nearby, close to work, good office chair & desk for working at home, easy check-in without coordinating schedules, large WiFi connected TV's with Netflix to relax, personalized recommendations to meet like-minded folks, access to outdoor and fitness areas... and plenty more. As a former employee traveling for work in the finance industry, I realized that staying in hotels for long periods wasn't all it was chalked up to be... and that I could help provide a better experience for other travelers also. 

I've hosted hundreds of guests from around the US and world, and have studios to 2 bedroom apartments around the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley: 
- Mountain View
- San Jose
- Redwood City
- Oakland (quick commute to San Francisco)
- Richmond

Send me a message and let's see what we can find closest to your work that meets your needs.

I LOVE the San Francisco Bay Area, and I want you to also! I've lived here for over a decade, and there may be no other place in the world that offers the mix of opportunity, great weather, beautiful nature, urban activities, events, concerts, sporting events, and all kinds of great people.

I'll provide you my own local guide of activities, meetups for your personal interests, and do my best to enjoying your time in the Bay, being productive, staying active, and making the most of your time here (or you're welcome to relax.. we're just here when you need us.)

I have personally stayed in over 25 different Airbnb apartments around the US and the world, so I also know a thing or two about what makes a great furnished home and host. And will do my best to provide that to you. 

A little more about me personally: I've lived in California my whole life, and graduated from San Francisco State University, with a major in Economics and minor in Finance. I've lived all over the Bay Area, including most of the homes I host on Airbnb. I used to work for the State of California in bank regulation, before providing furnished homes and great stays to my guests full-time. 

I enjoy learning and sharing with other Airbnb hosts and real estate investors. In my free time, I also enjoy water color painting, karaoke, beaches, traveling, and making people happy :) 

I realize the San Francisco Bay Area gets very busy and can be quite pricey relative to other locations, so please send me a message so I can see what affordable home we can get you, before everything gets booked up. Thank you for your time.

I'm passionate about teaching and spreading the joy of dance, especially partner dance.  I also collect rare plants and have a beautiful and interesting (if a tad unruly) garden, which I tend to all by myself, hence the unruly part.  I love to cook, but my diet is pretty basic, mostly plants, simply prepared with very little processed foods.  I'm a good conversationalist, but my schedule is erratic, so no guarantee I'll be around when you want to talk.  Happy to supply you with all the info you want about the area!  I can't live without good friends, integrity, laughter, dancing, new things to try, and nature.  When I travel, it's usually dance related, although I did achieve my dream of an English country garden tour a few years ago.   I spent the month of July in Sweden and Norway for 8 years studying a European jazz dance (boogie woogie) that I fell in love with.  My home is a quiet space, good for people who want to rest when they get back to their room, not good for people who want to party in their room, rather than on the town. (Also not good for smokers.

I am an adjunct professor of composition, literature and critical thinking in the San Francisco Bay Area.  In addition to teaching work at the university/college level, I greatly enjoy experiences of the natural and social worlds, including arts, culture, and nature.  I am a writer and engage with other creative activities, though my interests are broad.

As a traveler, I typically look to have experiences outside of a typical tourist frame of mind, and enjoy immersive experiences of place that are natural and uncontrived, though good museums are always appreciated.

As a guest, I am generally easy-going and open-natured, though I do like a bit of privacy during my stays, I am open to conversations and good relations with you.  Positive vibes all around.

In addition, some things I like include:

Night ocean swimming

Research, writing, creative work

Cinema

Exploring spaces

Gatherings and outings with friends

Very pleased to meet you!


Olá! Como você está? Sou professora de literatura e escrita. Moro em São Francisco e desfruto de atividades criativas, sociais e intelectuais. Estou planejando visitar o Brasil durante um mês para participar de projetos criativos com amigos em São Paulo e outras partes do Brasil. Eu falo um pouco de português, embora principalmente inglês. Não hesite em fazer perguntas sobre as quais você possa estar curioso. Muito prazer!

I grew up in Boston, MA and graduated from Boston University with a Bachelor Degree’s in Finance. After graduation, I moved to the Seattle area for a year but decided to settle in Oakland in 1992, where I raised my two sons, who are now adults.
I enjoy dancing, checking out real estate, skiing, traveling, wine tasting, and listening to live music, or simply cooking for my family and friends. Why cooking? I enjoy hosting a small party because I enjoy setting a pretty table, playing with the lighting and music, stocking the bathroom with cute items, and making my cocktail and dinner menus. These are all a sort of an artistic exercise that I find very satisfying. It’s a lot of work but it’s just very nice to see everyone dolled up and happy. At the end of the party, I feel I’ve contributed my gift to everyone, especially to my family and friends. I consider myself a great cook and a great bartender. One of things I enjoy most to make is seafood; I also love to mix cocktails with fresh herbs before dinner and then serve red wine at dinner. I know seafood is not supposed to pair with red wine but I like drinking red wine with anything. Who wouldn’t like it, right?
Since I am an empty nester and a world traveler, I have always been looking for new places to travel and eat. When I travel whether domestically and internationally or whether staying in a hotel or an Airbnb, I do pay a lot attention to cleanliness and comfort, amenities, and the location of the stay. My utmost priority is a comfortable bed and cleanliness. I don’t smoke. I am very tidy, clean, and respectful with my surroundings. I take my world traveling, dining out, cooking and hosting experience into consideration to provide the ultimate guest experience at my place for you.

** we are not accepting long term stays at this time (maximum 5 nights) **

Please join us soon in our cute Oakland retreat! We have a lovely guesthouse with all sorts of thoughtful touches to make your stay comfortable and clean. We have upped our cleaning game to ensure a covid-safe environment. Our little cottage has a shower, Nespresso maker, microwave, small refrigerator, sink, heat and fun treats for those late night cravings. This would be a wonderful place for someone in need of some private R&R or a couple looking to explore the sights by day and rest by night. Oakland has SO much to explore- and our location maximizes convenience with some lesser known gems nearby as well. Less than a mile from 580 & 880 freeways, the up and coming Laurel District, and taco truck paradise in Fruitvale... what more could you want! Just north of us are the beautiful and undervalued Joaquin Miller trails. Alameda is a quick little drive down High street. Take a lyft to Fruitvale BART and head on to San Francisco in less than 20 minutes! 
Explore or restore, our little tiny home is neat and cheerful.

Thank you for reading- we look forward to making your stay as comfortable, informed, and respected as possible!


We hope you love the fun pops of color and charming style we have blended to make this space special! 

Just to clarify: your entry will be semi-private in that you will pass our main house as you make your way to the cottage! We have a gated entry with a code and several gated yards.

A new restaurant, indie boutique, or bar seemingly opens every other week, with nearly 125 opened in the past decade. Billed as the arts and entertainment district of Oakland, it fulfills its promise, particularly during the boisterous Art Murmur on First Fridays.

The former is mostly a live music venue; the latter channels its inner flapper often (classic movies with a live organ player). Art galleries, run by the artists or by volunteers, are opening in brick warehouses. Down side streets are scenes of the start-up, DIY revolution with co-ops, an urban winery, entrepreneur hubs, and creative centers.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/7078503e-10e1-46f9-bda6-b757f971a10d.jpg,221290925,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/221290925,Trish,2018-10-18,"Kensington, CA",Hi and welcome!

I'll be your host during your stay. :) I live next door to my airbnb listing,  so I'm there to help if you need anything. 

What am I like as a host?

I am a planner. I like to prepare ahead of time to ensure you have a great experience arriving at my home, during your stay, and when you head home. 

Go ahead. Cook a good meal, take a shower, sleep in and get your beauty rest! You'll find you have everything you need to be nice &  comfy while you're staying with me. I aim to be responsive and provide anything you might need to make your stay enjoyable. If you need anything at all,  just pop me a note. :)

If I'm not hosting you, then you may be hosting me! I love to travel!

What am I like as a house guest?  

Well...  I keep spaces clean and tidy. Usually sleep at 10:30pm or 11pm. I wake up around 7am and I work remotely from 8:30am to 6pm Pacific time for my employer. I often work remotely while traveling. 

I don't smoke. I don't own pets.  I'm a digital marketer by trade. Originally, I am from Berkeley, CA.

I'm originally from sun - soaked LA, but spent 8yrs in Geneva Switzerland, New York City for 12 mos, Santa Monica for 5yrs and now Oakland for 3.5yrs. I love being active and outside - Surfing, biking, hiking and skiing are some of my favorite things to do.  A perfect day would be a bike ride in the morning, a sail at sunset, and then, in the evening, dinner and live music with close friends.  Always looking for the next big adventure / challenge with a stay 'in the moment' perspective! (Website hidden by Airbnb)

I'm also honored to have over 250 great reviews on Airbnb. While we accept shorter reservations, we specialize in providing furnished homes for 1-12 months, and have noticed many of our customers are business travelers and travel nurses. And we know what they want!

Safe homes with amenities and transportation nearby, close to work, good office chair & desk for working at home, easy check-in without coordinating schedules, large WiFi connected TV's with Netflix to relax, personalized recommendations to meet like-minded folks, access to outdoor and fitness areas... and plenty more. As a former employee traveling for work in the finance industry, I realized that staying in hotels for long periods wasn't all it was chalked up to be... and that I could help provide a better experience for other travelers also. 

I've hosted hundreds of guests from around the US and world, and have studios to 2 bedroom apartments around the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley: 
- Mountain View
- San Jose
- Redwood City
- Oakland (quick commute to San Francisco)
- Richmond

Send me a message and let's see what we can find closest to your work that meets your needs.

I LOVE the San Francisco Bay Area, and I want you to also! I've lived here for over a decade, and there may be no other place in the world that offers the mix of opportunity, great weather, beautiful nature, urban activities, events, concerts, sporting events, and all kinds of great people.

I'll provide you my own local guide of activities, meetups for your personal interests, and do my best to enjoying your time in the Bay, being productive, staying active, and making the most of your time here (or you're welcome to relax.. we're just here when you need us.)

I have personally stayed in over 25 different Airbnb apartments around the US and the world, so I also know a thing or two about what makes a great furnished home and host. And will do my best to provide that to you. 

A little more about me personally: I've lived in California my whole life, and graduated from San Francisco State University, with a major in Economics and minor in Finance. I've lived all over the Bay Area, including most of the homes I host on Airbnb. I used to work for the State of California in bank regulation, before providing furnished homes and great stays to my guests full-time. 

I enjoy learning and sharing with other Airbnb hosts and real estate investors. In my free time, I also enjoy water color painting, karaoke, beaches, traveling, and making people happy :) 

I realize the San Francisco Bay Area gets very busy and can be quite pricey relative to other locations, so please send me a message so I can see what affordable home we can get you, before everything gets booked up. Thank you for your time.

I run this place with my friend, Cher, and my partner, James. We began operating this set of Airbnb accommodations in April 2022. We really enjoy welcoming our guests and are excited to build out some additional shared space for y'all to enjoy.

Looking forward to meeting you! We will do our best to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.

Thanks for checking out my space. A little about me, I'm a native Houstonian that moved to the Bay Area six years ago to study at UC Berkeley. I've always used Airbnb when traveling so it's been quite an adventure creating my own listings. I've had the opportunity to meet people from all over the world, and make some lasting friendships.

My friend Eric and I banded together to purchase our home here in Berkeley last year and are using Airbnb to help afford the mortgage while we make improvements to the property. We both also have full-time jobs and work from home so we'll for sure get a chance to talk.

Look forward to meeting you!

Nate

Need a car too? Check out my car rental options on Turo! Airbnb doesn't allow links to be shared in profiles but just message me or search the area on Turo, if I have a car available I'll beat any other comparable (model, year) and confirmed rental price!",within an hour,100%,84%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-30371408/original/2de81028-a5aa-446f-b06e-1ead060a845e.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-30371408/original/2de81028-a5aa-446f-b06e-1ead060a845e.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,South Berkeley,7,9,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t,"Berkeley, California, United States",Paradise Park,,37.84706,-122.27845,Private room in home,Private room,2,,3 shared baths,,1,[],$55.00,2,365,2,2,365,365,2.0,365.0,,t,14,44,74,349,2023-12-20,16,16,0,2023-04-15,2023-10-25,4.94,5.0,4.88,4.81,5.0,4.5,4.81,,f,2,0,2,0,1.92

Thanks for checking out my space. A little about me, I'm a native Houstonian that moved to the Bay Area six years ago to study at UC Berkeley. I've always used Airbnb when traveling so it's been quite an adventure creating my own listings. I've had the opportunity to meet people from all over the world, and make some lasting friendships.

My friend Eric and I banded together to purchase our home here in Berkeley last year and are using Airbnb to help afford the mortgage while we make improvements to the property. We both also have full-time jobs and work from home so we'll for sure get a chance to talk.

Look forward to meeting you!

It is very rich in its history and culture. As in many inner city communities, West Oakland entails a range of backgrounds from the Locals, to the incoming gentrifiers to the Activists, Educators,  Artists, to the depresion that can be present when poverty exists. Just know you may see, hear about, or experience it all in West Oaklands Lower Bottoms/Prescott neighborhood. Our property is not the Oakland Hills, it is a melting pot of Oaklands lively hood at its best, and what others may see to be its worst at times. <br /><br />The neighbors in the building and on the block are great. Everyone gets a long easy. So if you are comfortable in the inner city please come spend some time here with us. If not, maybe look toward the hills, Lake Merritt, or Peidmont areas.

I have now built a team, feel free to book or message me first; My team is friendly, outgoing, and happy to answer any specific questions in advance.
 
I am a well-traveled guest who knows what hosts should do to create a comfortable experience. My goal is to fulfill these requirements for every guest.

Through the Airbnb hosting endeavor, I aim to provide the best possible experience to all visitors through excellent service and quality local recommendations! Nothing is more reassuring and calming than finding a place that feels like a second home on your travels.

I have now built a team, feel free to book or message me first; My team is friendly, outgoing, and happy to answer any specific questions in advance.

Through the Airbnb hosting endeavor, I aim to provide the best possible experience to all visitors through excellent service and quality local recommendations! Nothing is more reassuring and calming than finding a place that feels like a second home on your travels.

I have now built a team, feel free to book or message me first; My team is friendly, outgoing, and happy to answer any specific questions in advance.
