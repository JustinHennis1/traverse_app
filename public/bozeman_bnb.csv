Here is the back story to that rather strange sounding statement. My husband is from Alaska but went to dental school in San Francisco, where we met. He knew he had to get back to the mountains - so we spent the late 1990's searching for our ""forever"" college/mountain town. Our first visit to Bozeman and we knew it would be our future community - but the search for the ""forever"" home proved more difficult. 

Eventually, we placed notes on the doors of our favorite Bozeman homes, promising 20 years of rhubarb pies to anyone who led us to our forever home. Jane, the sweet grandmother who owned this 1920's  former sorority house responded, saying she had a rhubarb plant in the backyard and wanted to sell to a young family who would take good care of the place - and the rest is history. 

The summer of 2020 we will deliver our 20th rhubarb pie to Jane! 

Here are a few other details you might want to know about your potential host (Website hidden by Airbnb) taught culture related courses (e.g. ""The Cultural Dimensions of International Business"" & ""Film, Photos & Culture: A Global Perspective"") at Montana State University for about 15 years until I retired in 2020. My husband, Scott, daughter, Sumner and I were part-time ski instructors at Big Sky in the past, but now just ski for fun.

Scott is an avid bike rider, and even completed the 2,500+ mile ""Great Divide Mountain Bike Ride"" in the fall of 2016. Which means he rode from Banff, Canada to Mexico, on a mountain bike. He did it over a series of week-long segments - camping out along the way. When he is not riding he works doing dentistry here in Bozeman. 

Sumner studied ""Global Health & Education"" at Colorado College, and graduated in 2018. She nordic and Alpine skis, runs and climbs and is now in medical school at the University of Washington. 

Sumner's pup, Magnolia is a Bernedoodle. She is very friendly - but a bit shy at first.  She might bark - and also wag her tail - the 1st time she see's you but once you've been introduced she warms up quickly.

We are looking forward to hosting you, and hope you have a great experience here in Bozeman!

During that time our family lived abroad in Lugano, Switzerland, and then Surrey, England for over 9 years, returning to our home once or twice a year to stay in touch with lovely Bozeman and our wonderful local friends. We are originally from Connecticut and have lots of family there that we visit regularly. I’ve been back in Bozeman full time for about 8 years and love all the many activities MT has to offer including skiing, snow shoeing, hiking, cycling, camping, tennis, pickleball, yoga  and so much more. 

I have two sons, one who graduated from the US Naval Academy Annapolis and is now a Marine Officer stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. The other graduated from University College London, England Medical School and is currently working as a doctor in London and is a competitive rower. 

I’m busy managing my rental properties located on the edge of the MSU campus and our lovely Yellow Dogs guest Cottage along with working as a Property Manager for others. 

Our Yellow Dogs are named Rumo & Tater.  You will occasionally see them playing and chasing balls in the fenced in backyard.
