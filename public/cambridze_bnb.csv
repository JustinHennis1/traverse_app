New England is a great place to visit so I look forward to meeting you soon!

A little bit about me…
Originally from Florida, I found my way to New England via Spain where I lived and worked for 10 years! I have resided in Cambridge for the past 16 years and love everything it has to offer. I know the city well and can give you tips on things to do, places to see, and where to eat! 

My partner, Steve, and I are both retired from the education field. I was a Spanish teacher and he retired as a library director. We love to travel, cook, and spend time with friends and family.  

Hope you will plan to visit, we would love to host you.",N/A,N/A,N/A,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/7579202/profile_pic/1382883576/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/7579202/profile_pic/1382883576/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Cambridge,2,2,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States",East Cambridge,,42.37121,-71.08116,Private room in bed and breakfast,Private room,2,,1 private bath,,1,[],,3,90,3,3,90,90,3.0,90.0,,,0,0,0,0,2023-12-27,228,0,0,2013-12-01,2022-06-15,4.84,4.85,4.92,4.94,4.9,4.87,4.77,STR-14761,f,2,0,2,0,1.86

Favorite places are Seattle where I lived years, and Central and South America where I work/volunteer when possible.  Nearby, Davis Square,sailing in Boston Harbor, or road trips in New England top the list.

My property is near and dear to my heart as this was my grandparents home that I pretty much grew up in and that I bought after they passed away. I recently decided to turn my beautiful peice of property into a place where visitors can come and enjoy all this wonderful city has to offer while staying in a place of history vs a hotel!

In 2012, the state of Massachusetts designated Central Square as an official Cultural District.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/prohost-api/Hosting-46660533/original/4f73b9e3-200a-48ec-a014-0fa5e74bd5e7.jpeg,107434423,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/107434423,Blueground,2016-12-16,"New York, NY","We’re Blueground, a global proptech company with several thousand move-in-ready apartments in a growing number of major cities around the world.

As for me I'm very sociable person and Airbnb gives me an opportunity to meet different people each time.
I also like to keep things clean and organized and spend most of my time reading books, doing research on a healthy lifestyle and of course trying to live one! :)

I truly enjoy hosting Airbnb and I think it's a great community of people, almost like a world web of great hosts and guests.
As for me I'm very sociable person and Airbnb gives me an opportunity to meet different people each time.
I also like to keep things clean and organized and spend most of my time reading books, doing research on a healthy lifestyle and of course trying to live one! :)

Before I left Charleston, I started taking surf lessens so that I would have something to do at the beach if I went by myself. At night, I like to go out with my friends or dance. I started taking ballroom dance my senior year of college and continued once I returned from overseas.  I recently picked up sailing again; I first sailed when I was young as a boy scout.

I'm ridiculously goal oriented.  Idle hands are the devils workshop... So I have plans on getting my first masters from ODU in Engineering Management, a easy to get masters due to my job.  Second maybe a pol-mil masters from either Stanford, Harvard or Yale.  Not sure what in yet, we'll see about that later.  And eventually either an EMBA or MBA in international economics.  My high school history teacher that I see every year asked me if i thought about a PhD.  I think I would rather have several masters and be more ""well rounded""

The diverse area is well known for its wide variety of ethnic restaurants, bars, live music and theatre venues. Many startups have moved research and office operations into the Square to take advantage of the relatively low costs and the proximity to MIT. Nearly demolished in the 1950’s, the neighborhood was spared and went so far as to experience a sort of renaissance. In 2012, the state of Massachusetts designated Central Square as an official Cultural District.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/prohost-api/Hosting-1020115334294372563/original/040e20aa-27df-419b-888b-fcd0bab03353.jpeg,107434423,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/107434423,Blueground,2016-12-16,"New York, NY","We’re Blueground, a global proptech company with several thousand move-in-ready apartments in a growing number of major cities around the world.
