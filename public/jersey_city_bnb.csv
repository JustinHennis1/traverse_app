If you're looking for a safe, comfortable place with fabulous amenities and Wi-Fi (we know you need the Wi-Fi!) in the Boston MA area, Washington DC, Miami FL or very close to NYC in Jersey City or Hoboken, we'd love to host you. Many of the buildings where our apartments are located feature amenities such as beautiful lobbies, 24 hour front desk staff, fitness centers, business centers, recreation rooms, indoor or outdoor pools and whirlpools. If you are traveling with children, some buildings offer playgrounds (many buildings are near public playgrounds as well) or indoor playrooms. Depending on the location, you can stay for just a few days, a week, a month or more. 

We offer an assortment of short-term apartments in sizes ranging from a studio to three bedrooms that are fully furnished with all the comforts of home. Our local staff meticulously prepares your apartment before your arrival, and we offer 24 hour assistance for any emergencies after business hours. When you arrive at your apartment, the beds will be made, towels and bath amenities will be stocked in the bathrooms, and the coffee maker will be set up in the kitchen with some sample coffees, sweetener and creamer (teabags too if that is your preference) to start your morning off properly. If you’d like to cook a meal, the kitchen is stocked with dishes, cutlery, glassware and pots and pans. The living room is set up with a TV and cable channels, and the Wi-Fi router password and instructions will be prominently displayed so you can get connected quickly. You can also make local and toll-free phone calls at no charge.

I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well!

I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well! 

Any and all questions welcome! I want to make sure you have a great time in Jersey City & NYC.

Hello, and welcome to our home. My husband and I would be so happy to host you in our newly constructed Jersey City condo. We both share a huge passion for travel, and we have been blessed to live and visit many places all over the world. Chris and I decided to root ourselves in the city that has so much to offer which is Jersey City. While settling here, we decided to give our fellow travel lovers a place that feels like home. With southern hospitality in our roots, we have a deep love for hosting, and we look forward to extending that love and warmth to our new friends.
Our modern, sun-drenched condo offers a tranquil vibe, which is perfect to come home to after a long day of exploring the city. This location is perfect for families who want to visit Jersey City  or New York area. The location is prime for any sports enthusiasts as we are a quick fifteen-minute drive to MetLife stadium—home of the New York Giants and New York Jets. The area is also suited for travel healthcare professionals, as we are near many hospitals including Jersey City hospital. Newark international airport is a quick twelve-minute drive and in thirty minutes you are in the BIG APPLE! New York City.

I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well! 

Any and all questions welcome! I want to make sure you have a great time in Jersey City & NYC.

If you're looking for a safe, comfortable place with fabulous amenities and Wi-Fi (we know you need the Wi-Fi!) in the Boston MA area, Washington DC, Miami FL or very close to NYC in Jersey City or Hoboken, we'd love to host you. Many of the buildings where our apartments are located feature amenities such as beautiful lobbies, 24 hour front desk staff, fitness centers, business centers, recreation rooms, indoor or outdoor pools and whirlpools. If you are traveling with children, some buildings offer playgrounds (many buildings are near public playgrounds as well) or indoor playrooms. Depending on the location, you can stay for just a few days, a week, a month or more. 

We offer an assortment of short-term apartments in sizes ranging from a studio to three bedrooms that are fully furnished with all the comforts of home. Our local staff meticulously prepares your apartment before your arrival, and we offer 24 hour assistance for any emergencies after business hours. When you arrive at your apartment, the beds will be made, towels and bath amenities will be stocked in the bathrooms, and the coffee maker will be set up in the kitchen with some sample coffees, sweetener and creamer (teabags too if that is your preference) to start your morning off properly. If you’d like to cook a meal, the kitchen is stocked with dishes, cutlery, glassware and pots and pans. The living room is set up with a TV and cable channels, and the Wi-Fi router password and instructions will be prominently displayed so you can get connected quickly. You can also make local and toll-free phone calls at no charge. 

Please contact us to confirm the exact availability of the apartment you are interested in. We’d love to host you (and your family) for your vacation or business trip.
