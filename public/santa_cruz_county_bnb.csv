Other nights a quite family of four arrives just to get away from the New York winter. In Davenport with a population of three hundred you get to know everybody quick. The local pub and bakery have two community events every week its quite a hoot. I'm 40 and love the area , born and raised in these hills and know every great hiking trail, every great surf spot, every great and marvelous thing to do and see in this area. We have a fun basket of toys and game equipment thats been donated by travelers and has accumulated over time , so we have wet suits and surf boards to frisbees and golf clubs.  My days are full  tending to the traveler and everyday I'm grateful to have the opportunity to share with people the villa space and all the beautiful things this area has to offer. This has taken almost half a life time to attain. I have traveled the world and lived in other places but I always find myself back in the Santa Cruz area.

It has boogie boarding, surfing, great sand for sandcastles, and wonderful views. The beach has no public parking, so it is inhabited by mostly locals and doesn't get too crowded. Also, at night it is a great beach for bonfires.  We hope you enjoy the house!

The heart is Seacliff Village, a small collection of shops and restaurants along Center Avenue.  The most well known of these places are Manuel’s Mexican Restaurant (in business over 50 years) and Marianne’s Ice Cream.<br /><br />The icon of the neighborhood has got to be the sunken concrete ship, the S.S. Palo Alto.  The Palo Alto was towed to its present location and intentionally sunk in 1930.  The idea was to create an amusement ship and tourist draw, but the enterprise went bankrupt two years after opening its doors.  Seacliff remained a quiet, sleepy place until after World War II, when hundreds of summer homes began to spring up.  The area residents have worked to keep the neighborhood largely quiet despite its growth, and today it remains a quaint seaside enclave, famous for its foggy summers.""

Hello to anyone reviewing my home. I hope we will meet you soon. COVID has changed everything. I have only just now re-opened. Welcome back. Prior to the shutdown, we hosted happy travelers from 23 countries, were super hosts and had many positive reviews. 

For those of you traveling into Santa Cruz County.... our home is centrally located and close to highway one and the beach. Occasionally, there may be some freeway noise. 

My rooms are on the second floor, up stairs. My doorway requires a step up of four inches. Therefore I have to say my home is not very accessible at all. We HAVE accommodated a gentleman who just had knee surgery, and two guests with canes, who took good advantage of my staircase bannisters. 

My home is in a neighborhood with streetlights and sidewalks, and I have a very long driveway so you can park off the street.
Spring is upon us, and the days are crisp and sunny, reaching 80’s and low nineties. My home has no air conditioning, but it’s almost always a comfortable temp. The nights are in the 40's and 50's.

The beaches are very occupied, and the tourists and events are back thankfully, so our community has returned to its full and busy feel. 

We are doing our best with COVID. 
Hope to be hosting you soon.

Building the house was my retirement dream, after a 27 year career in Special Education. I was proud to create a successful program to support  18 to 22 year old autistic and other neurodivergent students. This Adult Transition Program was the first in Orange County focused on integrating these students with their peers at Orange Coast College. My staff and I helped each student, with creative job development,  individually tailored to their strengths, interests, and talents, to find work that many sustained for decades. Prior to creating this Adult Transition Program, I was the director of a school for neglected and delinquent group-home teenagers in San Francisco. Carolyn and I were college sweethearts many, many years ago, at a small Quaker College  in Indiana (Earlham). We stayed friends through marriages, raising our families, and rediscovered our love for each other after losses. Carolyn is a Psychologist and Coach, with a private practice using the Enneagram as a tool to support individuals, couples, business leaders and creatives in their growth, and the integration of head, heart and hands, to become all that they can be.  Her first career was as a Spanish Bilingual teacher in San Francisco, while Bob was working with younger students in residential treatment at ClearWater Ranch in Anderson Valley, California. We've been so happy to discover that we each maintained interests in photography, travel, hiking, snorkeling, swimming in wild waters over all the years, and are thrilled to do so together in this reignited relationship. We also enjoy playing tennis, hiking the many trails here and in Marin County, and sharing each other's friends and family. We were both psychology majors in college, where we first worked with underserved populations. We have a photo history of coast to coast adventures from the past, and we're adding more, now.

My life therefore has been about relationships that matter. 
     I am a photographer.  I love travel and color and the combination of both is  ideal for me.  
     I love hosting couples, groups of women as well as their family members. I g love their complete immersion into the pleasure of our home and its' surrounding areas.  I love my reviews when people ""get it"" when it comes to our  beach home.  It's fun to hear they spent time trying to imagine the stories that went behind each segment  of decor.    I LOVE France, and then Italy, and Morocco.  Canada is up there too, because they speak French (even though I don't). 
    I also fancy myself a chef (colorful, tasteful, healthy food).   Don't forget to check out all the cookbooks and international magazines.   You will know that I love cooking when you see our custom designed kitchen, the myriad of cooking utensils, french door refrigerator, Viking Stove and Bosch Dishwasher.   The french doors off the dining area open out  to extend your eating areas and invite you for morning  a cup of coffee outside.   The french doors off the living room invite you to watch the fog roll away under the palm tree.  This is yet another thing I love. 
       Walt and I have been married for 35 years.  He is still in practice as a psychologist and has taught mindfulness meditation for about 30 years.  He is the quiet type but rarely sits still.
     Interior design with elegance, color, history and a sense of whimsy would well describe another of my passions.  I like changing things up from time to time so my return guests get to do it all over again.  I love exploring our area for new things for us to do as well as always keep it fun for our guests and their children.  As nice as the house is I encourage everyone to get out there and enjoy  the outside and outlying areas as well.  Nicene Marks is almost within walking distance   The beach is a short stroll.
        I like establishing a relationship with my guests before they arrive, so I know what they need and they know what I appreciate in a guest.  People ask me, ""how can you let strangers come in to this lovely home""?  Oddly, its not a problem.  To me our home is not a typical rental.  It is a shared lovely home and I think my guests understand that and feel honored to be there.  They want to maintain our relationship and so do I.
     You will get a feel for my passions as you sit on the couch in front of the fireplace, or on one of the many decks and peruse the books on design, photography, cooking and sweet novels that take place on or near the beach.

Welcome to my Aptos beach house. A little bit about me...

I spent 15 years living and working overseas with my family in Morocco, Lithuania, and Costa Rica. I returned to California in 2015 and fell in love with Aptos and the Monterey Bay for its beautiful beaches, mountains, and access to the San Francisco Bay Area. As a beach lover, surfer, runner, and hiker, I found Aptos to be the perfect spot to enjoy nature, the beach, and the mountains all with having quick access to San Francisco to see a Giant's baseball game or to head into Oakland or Berkeley for Ethiopian, Greek, or Indian food, to see a show, or hike in the hills. 

I love adventure travel and do most of my traveling with my kids so I understand what parents are looking for in a vacation - ease and simplicity, memory making, less time in the car and more time doing fun things together, etc.  I believe that showing children the world as often and as early as possible is important. 

“Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime.” - Mark Twain

I hope you enjoy my beach home and hope that you are able to explore, learn, enjoy life's simple pleasures, and make lasting memories there.
Warmly,

Vacation Home Management

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to). And our guests book vacations confidently knowing they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for without any surprises.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team. Our passion and focus remain true: to empower our homeowners, guests, and employees to invest in vacation.",within an hour,100%,100%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/a3b3f146-aae6-4013-8c78-c36f62adebee.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/a3b3f146-aae6-4013-8c78-c36f62adebee.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Santa Cruz,83,257,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Unincorporated Areas,,37.10791,-122.05714,Entire cabin,Entire home/apt,4,,1 bath,,2,[],$145.00,2,1125,2,7,2,1125,2.2,73.6,,t,24,54,84,359,2023-12-31,96,13,2,2018-08-12,2023-12-23,4.59,4.76,4.63,4.76,4.65,4.7,4.46,,t,3,3,0,0,1.46

A little bit about me.....
I am a jewelry designer & interior designer based out of Santa Cruz, Ca. I’ve lived in Santa Cruz for over 17yrs. One of my favorite things is to share with others about my town & create a beautiful cozy space to host friends, family + Airbnb guests. It brings me joy to make others happy & to enjoy the beautiful town I’m lucky to live in.

A bit uncompromising yet spending a lifetime self-employed has, more or less, allowed me to live on my own terms. 
I was a retail merchant of beachwear & skateboards, transitioning into manufacture of skateboards/wheels and sponsoring the 1978 World Champion Downhill Racing Team.

The next two decades, I turned an avocation into a vocation, as a wine wholesaler.

Jesse likes to write (fiction), and run/swim/bike (triathlons). He even rode the Tour de France route (as a non-professional cyclist) in 2008.

His wife loves photography and his kids love the beach, ice cream, eating french fries, riding bicycles, and reading. 

We LOVE traveling as a family and new adventures.

Vacation Home Management

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to). And our guests book vacations confidently knowing they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for without any surprises.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team. Our passion and focus remain true: to empower our homeowners, guests, and employees to invest in vacation.",within an hour,100%,99%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/f562dcb6-50a0-4cce-b082-5ef0dc2a1087.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/f562dcb6-50a0-4cce-b082-5ef0dc2a1087.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,South Lake Tahoe,120,639,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t,,City of Santa Cruz,,36.96487,-122.02217,Entire home,Entire home/apt,3,,1 bath,,2,[],$188.00,2,1125,2,7,2,1125,2.2,168.9,,t,25,49,79,347,2023-12-31,77,19,0,2020-09-25,2023-11-26,4.57,4.65,4.6,4.69,4.61,4.99,4.32,,t,1,1,0,0,1.94

We wanted to embrace the Santa Cruz lifestyle with a beach house-style home.    I was born and raised in Hawaii, and I wanted a home away from home. So the island decor fits perfectly with the house location to the surf, beach, and the Aloha Grill down the street.  Our kids love the bunk beds, and we made one of the rooms into a surfer decor to bring the Santa Cruz surf style to life. The beach, which is a short walk away, was perfect for beach lovers alike.  It has boogie boarding, surfing, great sand for sandcastles, and wonderful views. The beach has no public parking, so it is inhabited by mostly locals and doesn't get too crowded. Also, at night it is a great beach for bonfires.  We hope you enjoy the house!
