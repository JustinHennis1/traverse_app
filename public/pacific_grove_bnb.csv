We enjoy good food & often dine at the fine restaurants in downtown Pacific Grove, nearby Cannery Row, Carmel By-the-Sea, and south to Big Sur. Hiking in Point Lobos, Big Sur, & Carmel Valley's Garland Park are a great way to spend a day & our favorite activity is sailing our 40' Passport on beautiful Monterey Bay where whales & otters can be spotted year round.

We partner with Airbnb to provide travelers unique and unforgettable vacation experiences during their stays. Regardless of whether you are on a leisure or a business trip, our goal is to make sure you stay at a relaxing, comfortable, and tranquil space where you would enjoy your best vacation time.

I truly believe our guests deserve the best! From selecting the furniture, mattresses to even bath towels and silverwares, we always ensure that any items we provide to our guests have to be high end and stylish with highest quality to offer. Our interior design for each property is aimed to create an ambience of a relaxing vacation-like touch and feel with modern design elements.

Year after year, we have been adding new properties to our portfolios. We have over 25 vacation rental properties throughout California, including Bay Area, Pacific Grove, Half Moon Bay, Chico, Clear Lake and South Lake Tahoe. And we are expanding to the East Coast, Massachusetts, as well as Bora Bora, French Polynesia, and more and more amazing world-renowned travel destinations. We own all of our properties in order to provide the highest quality of service. 

When I travel, I always stay at Airbnb properties. I personally have very high expectations when staying away from home, and I hope all our properties meet yours, knowing you are traveling away from your home. My team members include my partner, Carrie, a customer service crew, a cleaning crew and a repair / handyman crew. They are on call 7-days a week at your service. We strive to exceed expectations to all of our guests with the utmost respect and respond. We will ensure each property is thoroughly cleaned with enhanced cleaning protocols, and with fresh bed sheets, towels, and bath rugs upon your arrival.

I am also an active member of Airbnb.org which is a non-profit organization started by the founders of Airbnb. On a daily basis, we donate a certain percentage of our revenue from each guest's booking to Airbnb.org. Our mission is to provide homes during times of crisis, and unlock the power of sharing space, resources, and support in times of needs! We partner with the worldwide communities to open housing in emergencies in order to offer shelters for people who lost their homes.

We partner with Airbnb to provide travelers unique and unforgettable vacation experiences during their stays. Regardless of whether you are on a leisure or a business trip, our goal is to make sure you stay at a relaxing, comfortable, and tranquil space where you would enjoy your best vacation time.

I truly believe our guests deserve the best! From selecting the furniture, mattresses to even bath towels and silverwares, we always ensure that any items we provide to our guests have to be high end and stylish with highest quality to offer. Our interior design for each property is aimed to create an ambience of a relaxing vacation-like touch and feel with modern design elements.

Year after year, we have been adding new properties to our portfolios. We have over 25 vacation rental properties throughout California, including Bay Area, Pacific Grove, Half Moon Bay, Chico, Clear Lake and South Lake Tahoe. And we are expanding to the East Coast, Massachusetts, as well as Bora Bora, French Polynesia, and more and more amazing world-renowned travel destinations. We own all of our properties in order to provide the highest quality of service. 

When I travel, I always stay at Airbnb properties. I personally have very high expectations when staying away from home, and I hope all our properties meet yours, knowing you are traveling away from your home. My team members include my partner, Carrie, a customer service crew, a cleaning crew and a repair / handyman crew. They are on call 7-days a week at your service. We strive to exceed expectations to all of our guests with the utmost respect and respond. We will ensure each property is thoroughly cleaned with enhanced cleaning protocols, and with fresh bed sheets, towels, and bath rugs upon your arrival.

I am also an active member of Airbnb.org which is a non-profit organization started by the founders of Airbnb. On a daily basis, we donate a certain percentage of our revenue from each guest's booking to Airbnb.org. Our mission is to provide homes during times of crisis, and unlock the power of sharing space, resources, and support in times of needs! We partner with the worldwide communities to open housing in emergencies in order to offer shelters for people who lost their homes.
