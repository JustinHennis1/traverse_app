We have 2 daughters and 3 grandchildren, all of whom live in Columbus.  I've been a yoga teacher since 1988. I have taught at Yoga on High since it's inception in 2000 and earned my certification from Yoga Alliance of ERYT 1500 at Yoga on High. I love sharing this ancient practice with all kinds of people. I have seen it have profound effects on people's lives. It is an honor and a responsibility for which I am very grateful. 
 Eric and I have lived in this historic home for over 35 years, in what we consider the best neighborhood in the city, Olde Towne. We love sharing our home with friends and now airbnb guests. We enjoy walking in the woods, gardening, biking, kayaking, reading and, of course, practicing yoga. 
We also love to travel. We've been told we are easy guests. We like to take care of ourselves and not add unduly to our hosts workload. Car camping is a favorite vacation of ours.
 I'd say our airbnb hosting style is also casual: I try to think of anything a guest might need and supply it, so they can have a relaxed stay with us. We have maps of the neighborhood and menus for the local cafes and the bakery in a notebook in The Loft. We try to help out with rides when we can. We have a table in The Loft that is perfect for working or dining. A guest set up her sewing machine up there.

University studies led me in Solo, Indonesia, and to South India with yoga and meditation with Sadhguru and the Isha Foundation to begin my inner exploration.

I started as a piano and theory teacher, occupational therapist, national yoga and movement instructor, Ayurvedic practitioner, motor scooter rider, and now gardener.

Clintonville has lots of restaurants, breweries, coffee shops, and bars, along with shops of all kinds, many of which are within a few block walk of our home. Our home is exactly halfway between High St, with all the stops and places to eat and drink, and the Olentangy Bike Trail, which takes you from downtown to the south, to Worthington, a few miles to the north, and several parks along the way.<br /><br />High St is Columbus’ main thoroughfare, and it can take you pretty much anywhere you need to go. Busses are frequent and inexpensive, and Uber or Lyft can take you downtown, OSU, or the Short North in just a few minutes.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/90dd0708-b758-4c8d-a6c1-08249a6e5c65.jpg,17639670,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/17639670,Elisabeth,2014-07-04,"Columbus, OH","Introvert who loves people.

Having stayed on friend's couches, in numerous hotel rooms, BNB's, and Airbnb the conversation has always centered on what would we do differently as a host.  From having a throw blanket for lounging on the couch, that certain kitchen tool, green space outside,  to having games available to play as a group or family. 

We try to be mindful of the earth and conservation. Our rental has general recycling available for our guests. If you are not sure if something can be recycled, leave it for us and we will make the decision for you. We also compost food. Leave us your leftovers (and scrap remnants if you like) in the refrigerator. The local composting company we work with that will even take meat and bones. 

Each of our animals has their own distinct personalities that make us smile and want to give them a hug.  This does not mean that everyone else does though. We each have several family members with pet allergies so we want there to be somewhere that is pet free, has items in it that have not been in contact with animals, like Wincott Place, to keep allergies at bay.

I live in one of my favorite places, Columbus, Ohio.  I moved here from NYC in 2014.

At Edifice, we algorithmically analyze and acquire foreclosures in qualified opportunity zones and develop those properties into vacation rentals that double as live-action guest experiences.  We work to reconceptualize residential real estate and the hotel industry, offering you the opportunity to book your own fantasy world.  Our primary goal is your satisfactory suspension of disbelief.  

We encourage you to raise the question:  why stay in a hotel room when I could otherwise rule from the pinnacles of King's Landing or Caesar's Palace, escape 1,000 leagues under the sea, wage my own wizard battle, establish a new dynasty at Pi-Ramesses, lead my lion pack into the Serengeti, cross swords with Hook in my pirate fortress, or cast down dragons in my own lair?  

I love great food and cocktails and am full of suggestions for fulfilling local experiences.  I also love animals.  I own cats and grew up with dogs.   I design my homes to be pet friendly and would love to meet your pets.  After all, your pets will be jealous if you fail to include them in your fantasy adventure.

We are always looking for new ideas, suggestions and guidance regarding our existing properties and ideas for future worlds.  Your assistance is commendable.

We understand that the true cost of a hotel includes the opportunity cost of your time and promise to work diligently to maximize your enjoyment from every second of your vacation adventure.

It had previously been an area of family operated farms and countryside stretching along the National Road, Main Street from Washington D.C. In 1882, trolley tracks were laid on Oak Street to Kelton Ave where the streetcar barn still stands, providing convenient transportation to the former location of the Ohio State Fairgrounds, (now Franklin Park Conservatory), and to downtown Columbus. Olde Towne East saw many of Columbus’s finest homes built within the area and much of that architectural legacy still exists today. There are more than a thousand uniquely styled homes in the Olde Towne East area, some built as early as 1830, representing over 50 unique architectural styles. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Olde Towne East represented some of the most popular American building styles spanning 100 years, which included: Federal, Italianate, Victorian, Queen Anne, Gothic Revival, Tudor.

I live in one of my favorite places, Columbus, Ohio.  I moved here from NYC in 2014.

At Edifice, we algorithmically analyze and acquire foreclosures in qualified opportunity zones and develop those properties into vacation rentals that double as live-action guest experiences.  We work to reconceptualize residential real estate and the hotel industry, offering you the opportunity to book your own fantasy world.  Our primary goal is your satisfactory suspension of disbelief.  

We encourage you to raise the question:  why stay in a hotel room when I could otherwise rule from the pinnacles of King's Landing or Caesar's Palace, escape 1,000 leagues under the sea, wage my own wizard battle, establish a new dynasty at Pi-Ramesses, lead my lion pack into the Serengeti, cross swords with Hook in my pirate fortress, or cast down dragons in my own lair?  

I love great food and cocktails and am full of suggestions for fulfilling local experiences.  I also love animals.  I own cats and grew up with dogs.   I design my homes to be pet friendly and would love to meet your pets.  After all, your pets will be jealous if you fail to include them in your fantasy adventure.

We are always looking for new ideas, suggestions and guidance regarding our existing properties and ideas for future worlds.  Your assistance is commendable.

We understand that the true cost of a hotel includes the opportunity cost of your time and promise to work diligently to maximize your enjoyment from every second of your vacation adventure.

I live in one of my favorite places, Columbus, Ohio.  I moved here from NYC in 2014.

At Edifice, we algorithmically analyze and acquire foreclosures in qualified opportunity zones and develop those properties into vacation rentals that double as live-action guest experiences.  We work to reconceptualize residential real estate and the hotel industry, offering you the opportunity to book your own fantasy world.  Our primary goal is your satisfactory suspension of disbelief.  

We encourage you to raise the question:  why stay in a hotel room when I could otherwise rule from the pinnacles of King's Landing or Caesar's Palace, escape 1,000 leagues under the sea, wage my own wizard battle, establish a new dynasty at Pi-Ramesses, lead my lion pack into the Serengeti, cross swords with Hook in my pirate fortress, or cast down dragons in my own lair?  

I love great food and cocktails and am full of suggestions for fulfilling local experiences.  I also love animals.  I own cats and grew up with dogs.   I design my homes to be pet friendly and would love to meet your pets.  After all, your pets will be jealous if you fail to include them in your fantasy adventure.

We are always looking for new ideas, suggestions and guidance regarding our existing properties and ideas for future worlds.  Your assistance is commendable.

We understand that the true cost of a hotel includes the opportunity cost of your time and promise to work diligently to maximize your enjoyment from every second of your vacation adventure.  You'll never again be comfortable sitting on your bed at the Hilton watching infomercials.

At Edifice, we algorithmically analyze and acquire foreclosures in qualified opportunity zones and develop those properties into vacation rentals that double as live-action guest experiences.  We work to reconceptualize residential real estate and the hotel industry, offering you the opportunity to book your own fantasy world.  Our primary goal is your satisfactory suspension of disbelief.  

We encourage you to raise the question:  why stay in a hotel room when I could otherwise rule from the pinnacles of King's Landing or Caesar's Palace, escape 1,000 leagues under the sea, wage my own wizard battle, establish a new dynasty at Pi-Ramesses, lead my lion pack into the Serengeti, cross swords with Hook in my pirate fortress, or cast down dragons in my own lair?  

I love great food and cocktails and am full of suggestions for fulfilling local experiences.  I also love animals.  I own cats and grew up with dogs.   I design my homes to be pet friendly and would love to meet your pets.  After all, your pets will be jealous if you fail to include them in your fantasy adventure.

We are always looking for new ideas, suggestions and guidance regarding our existing properties and ideas for future worlds.  Your assistance is commendable.

We understand that the true cost of a hotel includes the opportunity cost of your time and promise to work diligently to maximize your enjoyment from every second of your vacation adventure.

I live in one of my favorite places, Columbus, Ohio.  I moved here from NYC in 2014.

At Edifice, we algorithmically analyze and acquire foreclosures in qualified opportunity zones and develop those properties into vacation rentals that double as live-action guest experiences.  We work to reconceptualize residential real estate and the hotel industry, offering you the opportunity to book your own fantasy world.  Our primary goal is your satisfactory suspension of disbelief.  

We encourage you to raise the question:  why stay in a hotel room when I could otherwise rule from the pinnacles of King's Landing or Caesar's Palace, escape 1,000 leagues under the sea, wage my own wizard battle, establish a new dynasty at Pi-Ramesses, lead my lion pack into the Serengeti, cross swords with Hook in my pirate fortress, or cast down dragons in my own lair?  

I love great food and cocktails and am full of suggestions for fulfilling local experiences.  I also love animals.  I own cats and grew up with dogs.   I design my homes to be pet friendly and would love to meet your pets.  After all, your pets will be jealous if you fail to include them in your fantasy adventure.

We are always looking for new ideas, suggestions and guidance regarding our existing properties and ideas for future worlds.  Your assistance is commendable.

We understand that the true cost of a hotel includes the opportunity cost of your time and promise to work diligently to maximize your enjoyment from every second of your vacation adventure.  You'll never again be comfortable sitting on your bed at the Hilton watching infomercials.

I live in one of my favorite places, Columbus, Ohio.  I moved here from NYC in 2014.

At Edifice, we algorithmically analyze and acquire foreclosures in qualified opportunity zones and develop those properties into vacation rentals that double as live-action guest experiences.  We work to reconceptualize residential real estate and the hotel industry, offering you the opportunity to book your own fantasy world.  Our primary goal is your satisfactory suspension of disbelief.  

We encourage you to raise the question:  why stay in a hotel room when I could otherwise rule from the pinnacles of King's Landing or Caesar's Palace, escape 1,000 leagues under the sea, wage my own wizard battle, establish a new dynasty at Pi-Ramesses, lead my lion pack into the Serengeti, cross swords with Hook in my pirate fortress, or cast down dragons in my own lair?  

I love great food and cocktails and am full of suggestions for fulfilling local experiences.  I also love animals.  I own cats and grew up with dogs.   I design my homes to be pet friendly and would love to meet your pets.  After all, your pets will be jealous if you fail to include them in your fantasy adventure.

We are always looking for new ideas, suggestions and guidance regarding our existing properties and ideas for future worlds.  Your assistance is commendable.

We understand that the true cost of a hotel includes the opportunity cost of your time and promise to work diligently to maximize your enjoyment from every second of your vacation adventure.  You'll never again be comfortable sitting on your bed at the Hilton watching infomercials.

YOUR SPACE IS PRIVATE, WE HAVE SEPARATE KITCHENS. The only shared space is the few steps inside the exterior door to your entry. 

We really try to host folk who need longer stays - weeks to months, hence the 30 day minimum. Most of our guests are moving to Columbus and need a place to anchor for a while. I really want to communicate with before you book, in case for some reason this is not a good fit. We have lived here for many decades and know our way around so we often help with a wide variety of questions.

We hope the experiences we've gained through our own travels will be felt in the spaces we create for our guests.

Thank you for staying with us!  We look forward to hosting you.

Codi (my sister) and I have lived here for the past 3 years and have been hosting on Airbnb since 2017 which means you'll get high service and quality, local recommendations (especially if you love food and coffee as much as I do!)

Feel free to book or message us first, we are happy to answer any specific questions in advance.

I recently left the Army after a 10 year career that took me all over the world to pursue being a full time entrepreneur!  My ""preneur"" is building an Airbnb and real estate business with my sister Codi.  Codi is a full time recruiter for finance and hospitality positions for Goodwin Recruiting.  She handles all the messaging on airbnb so you will most likely be speaking to her.

I am well traveled and have a uniquely high cleanliness standard for all of our units (thanks to the Army).  I know what a host should do to create a comfortable, clean and safe experience and I'd like to prove it to you!

Be sure to ask about the best bars and restaurants in Columbus.  We know quite a few bar and restaurant owners and can definitely give you the best local recommendations and would love to help you enjoy Columbus in anyway we can!

Thank you for staying with us!  We look forward to hosting you.

Codi (my sister) and I have lived here for the past 3 years and have been hosting on Airbnb since 2017 which means you'll get high service and quality, local recommendations (especially if you love food and coffee as much as I do!)

Feel free to book or message us first, we are happy to answer any specific questions in advance.

I recently left the Army after a 10 year career that took me all over the world to pursue being a full time entrepreneur!  My ""preneur"" is building an Airbnb and real estate business with my sister Codi.  Codi is a full time recruiter for finance and hospitality positions for Goodwin Recruiting.  She handles all the messaging on airbnb so you will most likely be speaking to her.

I am well traveled and have a uniquely high cleanliness standard for all of our units (thanks to the Army).  I know what a host should do to create a comfortable, clean and safe experience and I'd like to prove it to you!

Be sure to ask about the best bars and restaurants in Columbus.  We know quite a few bar and restaurant owners and can definitely give you the best local recommendations and would love to help you enjoy Columbus in anyway we can!

I'm a communications professional who has been working from home for close to a decade and I immensely enjoy the benefits of WFH traveling. I especially enjoy being entrenched in the neighborhoods, which is why I love Airbnb. Having grown up in rural Ohio, I appreciate the beauty of countryside but fell in love with cityscape. I moved to Los Angeles after college, then spent years in downtown Chicago but found my way back to my home city: Columbus. I would describe myself as an urban culture-junkie, modern art lover, and amateur photographer; I enjoy music of all kinds, food, wine, coffee and I live for those experiences that broaden my perspectives and enrich my life.

When it comes to hosting, we are thrilled to host our German Village home.

We encourage walks in the brick-lined neighborhood - you’ll find bookstores, pubs, coffeeshops, gardens and gorgeous historical homes along the way.

Around the corner, there is a Lyft bike station, and down the street you can access the bike path which leads to downtown and beyond - a favorite way of ours to brewery hop. Additionally, being so close to downtown and accessible to highways, you are a short Lyft/Uber ride away from Franklinton, Downtown, Short North, Old Town East, THE Ohio State campus. You can’t beat the location!

If you are more interested in the history of my ancestors settling in German Village or the history of the family who owned this home for 100+ years, don’t hesitate to reach out.  As avid travelers and lovers of new experiences, you’ll see our nod to traveling throughout the house. 

We are excited to host you and share our beautiful neighborhood and German culture! Please let us know if you have any questions or needs.

Final note- as a city-dweller mama - I strived to make this home family-friendly so we have a pack and play, high chair, baby gate, kid toys in storage on-site as well as numerous children’s books. We’ve put outlet covers in most rooms to help curb curious toddlers.

Thank you for staying with us!  We look forward to hosting you.

Codi (my sister) and I have lived here for the past 3 years and have been hosting on Airbnb since 2017 which means you'll get high service and quality, local recommendations (especially if you love food and coffee as much as I do!)

Feel free to book or message us first, we are happy to answer any specific questions in advance.

I recently left the Army after a 10 year career that took me all over the world to pursue being a full time entrepreneur!  My ""preneur"" is building an Airbnb and real estate business with my sister Codi.  Codi is a full time recruiter for finance and hospitality positions for Goodwin Recruiting.  She handles all the messaging on airbnb so you will most likely be speaking to her.

I am well traveled and have a uniquely high cleanliness standard for all of our units (thanks to the Army).  I know what a host should do to create a comfortable, clean and safe experience and I'd like to prove it to you!

Be sure to ask about the best bars and restaurants in Columbus.  We know quite a few bar and restaurant owners and can definitely give you the best local recommendations and would love to help you enjoy Columbus in anyway we can!

Thomas graduated high school in Grove City and continued his education at Capital University, where he received a Bachelor’s degree in both Marketing and Accounting. While at school, Thomas worked his way through college in real estate. Many of his first clients were the classmates he was surrounded by every day. He had helped many young first-time homebuyers by the time he graduated and decided to pursue his real estate dream after graduation. 

Thomas works hard with each client to help them pinpoint what they want in a home. He believes that communication and a personal dedication to his clients set him apart in this market. Every buyer’s and seller’s journey is vastly different, and there is no “one size fits all” plan for a real estate client. It is more important than ever to have a knowledgeable real estate expert guiding you through the home buying and selling experience in an ever-changing real estate market. 

When Thomas is not negotiating a deal or showing a home, Thomas loves to explore the city with his partner, Vitalii. They currently reside in Clintonville and love biking, walking to the Park of Roses, and supporting one of the many businesses on High Street. Their favorite hangout spot is anywhere with a patio. In fact, the couple has a group of friends who gather weekly for backyard happy hours! In their free time, they prioritize exploring together, from checking out local festivals and events to traveling to new places near and far. Thomas is highly involved in his community and believes that one of the many things that makes Columbus so beautiful is the rich and supportive communities it offers. Thomas looks forward to seeing what else Columbus will bring as more people discover the beautiful place Columbus is to work and live.

Anywhere downtown, Grandview, or The Short North is a quick 5-10 min drive. Take a stroll through German Village which is home to many locally owned restaurants, breweries, and boutiques. I personally recommend Valter’s or Schmidts for an authentic German experience. Gresso’s, Planks and Roosters is also right here as well which is a great place for games and pub fare.  With proximity to Columbus John Glenn International airport, only 15 mins away, this is the perfect location for anyone in town for a short trip.

Thank you for staying with us!  We look forward to hosting you.

Codi (my sister) and I have lived here for the past 3 years and have been hosting on Airbnb since 2017 which means you'll get high service and quality, local recommendations (especially if you love food and coffee as much as I do!)

Feel free to book or message us first, we are happy to answer any specific questions in advance.

I recently left the Army after a 10 year career that took me all over the world to pursue being a full time entrepreneur!  My ""preneur"" is building an Airbnb and real estate business with my sister Codi.  Codi is a full time recruiter for finance and hospitality positions for Goodwin Recruiting.  She handles all the messaging on airbnb so you will most likely be speaking to her.

I am well traveled and have a uniquely high cleanliness standard for all of our units (thanks to the Army).  I know what a host should do to create a comfortable, clean and safe experience and I'd like to prove it to you!

Be sure to ask about the best bars and restaurants in Columbus.  We know quite a few bar and restaurant owners and can definitely give you the best local recommendations and would love to help you enjoy Columbus in anyway we can!

Thank you for staying with us!  We look forward to hosting you.

Codi (my sister) and I have lived here for the past 3 years and have been hosting on Airbnb since 2017 which means you'll get high service and quality, local recommendations (especially if you love food and coffee as much as I do!)

Feel free to book or message us first, we are happy to answer any specific questions in advance.

I recently left the Army after a 10 year career that took me all over the world to pursue being a full time entrepreneur!  My ""preneur"" is building an Airbnb and real estate business with my sister Codi.  Codi is a full time recruiter for finance and hospitality positions for Goodwin Recruiting.  She handles all the messaging on airbnb so you will most likely be speaking to her.

I am well traveled and have a uniquely high cleanliness standard for all of our units (thanks to the Army).  I know what a host should do to create a comfortable, clean and safe experience and I'd like to prove it to you!

Be sure to ask about the best bars and restaurants in Columbus.  We know quite a few bar and restaurant owners and can definitely give you the best local recommendations and would love to help you enjoy Columbus in anyway we can!

I live in one of my favorite places, Columbus, Ohio.  I moved here from NYC in 2014.

At Edifice, we algorithmically analyze and acquire foreclosures in qualified opportunity zones and develop those properties into vacation rentals that double as live-action guest experiences.  We work to reconceptualize residential real estate and the hotel industry, offering you the opportunity to book your own fantasy world.  Our primary goal is your satisfactory suspension of disbelief.  

We encourage you to raise the question:  why stay in a hotel room when I could otherwise rule from the pinnacles of King's Landing or Caesar's Palace, escape 1,000 leagues under the sea, wage my own wizard battle, establish a new dynasty at Pi-Ramesses, lead my lion pack into the Serengeti, cross swords with Hook in my pirate fortress, or cast down dragons in my own lair?  

I love great food and cocktails and am full of suggestions for fulfilling local experiences.  I also love animals.  I own cats and grew up with dogs.   I design my homes to be pet friendly and would love to meet your pets.  After all, your pets will be jealous if you fail to include them in your fantasy adventure.

We are always looking for new ideas, suggestions and guidance regarding our existing properties and ideas for future worlds.  Your assistance is commendable.

We understand that the true cost of a hotel includes the opportunity cost of your time and promise to work diligently to maximize your enjoyment from every second of your vacation adventure.

Thank you for staying with us!  We look forward to hosting you.

Codi (my sister) and I have lived here for the past 3 years and have been hosting on Airbnb since 2017 which means you'll get high service and quality, local recommendations (especially if you love food and coffee as much as I do!)

Feel free to book or message us first, we are happy to answer any specific questions in advance.

I recently left the Army after a 10 year career that took me all over the world to pursue being a full time entrepreneur!  My ""preneur"" is building an Airbnb and real estate business with my sister Codi.  Codi is a full time recruiter for finance and hospitality positions for Goodwin Recruiting.  She handles all the messaging on airbnb so you will most likely be speaking to her.

I am well traveled and have a uniquely high cleanliness standard for all of our units (thanks to the Army).  I know what a host should do to create a comfortable, clean and safe experience and I'd like to prove it to you!

Be sure to ask about the best bars and restaurants in Columbus.  We know quite a few bar and restaurant owners and can definitely give you the best local recommendations and would love to help you enjoy Columbus in anyway we can!

Lee and I were avid travelers as a couple and now, we love to travel with our little family, and so, we appreciate accommodations that are clean and convenient, but yet modern, sentimental and charming. 

We're all about the experience... making memories... getting to know people, and exploring new restaurants, breweries, music, markets, family-friendly attractions, and community events. When we travel, we desire uncomplicated and comfortable accommodations. So, we've set up our properties for you as if we were staying there; as an extension of our own home and with our personal touch.

Thank you for staying with us!  We look forward to hosting you.

Codi (my sister) and I have lived here for the past 3 years and have been hosting on Airbnb since 2017 which means you'll get high service and quality, local recommendations (especially if you love food and coffee as much as I do!)

Feel free to book or message us first, we are happy to answer any specific questions in advance.

I recently left the Army after a 10 year career that took me all over the world to pursue being a full time entrepreneur!  My ""preneur"" is building an Airbnb and real estate business with my sister Codi.  Codi is a full time recruiter for finance and hospitality positions for Goodwin Recruiting.  She handles all the messaging on airbnb so you will most likely be speaking to her.

I am well traveled and have a uniquely high cleanliness standard for all of our units (thanks to the Army).  I know what a host should do to create a comfortable, clean and safe experience and I'd like to prove it to you!

Be sure to ask about the best bars and restaurants in Columbus.  We know quite a few bar and restaurant owners and can definitely give you the best local recommendations and would love to help you enjoy Columbus in anyway we can!

The main reason my husband and I started this business together was so we could provide a great experience for guests to make beautiful memories of their own.  We LOVE to travel and we hope you do too!

As physical and mental health advocates, we understand research that states positive memory retrieval reduces stress levels and calms physiological stress responses. So get out and explore life with each other in our fun and comfortably curated properties and locals! We take pride in our city and would like people from all over the world to enjoy it as much as we do. When we’re not tending to other philanthropic or entrepreneurial pursuits, we are learning, loving, and growing with our three children, and our Australian Labradoodle.

Please make yourself at home at any of properties in the area whether you are looking to experience condo life near the lively atmosphere of downtown Columbus, the Short North, the Arena District, Ohio State University, a quiet single-family neighborhood home, or our 8-person sleeping RV, or fun water and sun (or snow) at our waterfront lake house on Buckeye Lake! 

Our detailed guidebooks are loaded with restaurants, bars, and things to do in the area, but don’t hesitate to reach out for any local recommendations. Start building your beautiful memories today!

Thank you for staying with us!  We look forward to hosting you.

Codi (my sister) and I have lived here for the past 3 years and have been hosting on Airbnb since 2017 which means you'll get high service and quality, local recommendations (especially if you love food and coffee as much as I do!)

Feel free to book or message us first, we are happy to answer any specific questions in advance.

I recently left the Army after a 10 year career that took me all over the world to pursue being a full time entrepreneur!  My ""preneur"" is building an Airbnb and real estate business with my sister Codi.  Codi is a full time recruiter for finance and hospitality positions for Goodwin Recruiting.  She handles all the messaging on airbnb so you will most likely be speaking to her.

I am well traveled and have a uniquely high cleanliness standard for all of our units (thanks to the Army).  I know what a host should do to create a comfortable, clean and safe experience and I'd like to prove it to you!

Be sure to ask about the best bars and restaurants in Columbus.  We know quite a few bar and restaurant owners and can definitely give you the best local recommendations and would love to help you enjoy Columbus in anyway we can!

We work to reconceptualize residential real estate and the hotel industry, offering you the opportunity to book your own fantasy world.  Our primary goal is your satisfactory suspension of disbelief.  

We encourage you to raise the question:  why stay in a hotel room when I could otherwise rule from the pinnacles of King's Landing or Caesar's Palace, escape 1,000 leagues under the sea, wage my own wizard battle, establish a new dynasty at Pi-Ramesses, lead my lion pack into the Serengeti, cross swords with Hook in my pirate fortress, or cast down dragons in my own lair?  

I love great food and cocktails and am full of suggestions for fulfilling local experiences.  I also love animals.  I own cats and grew up with dogs.   I design my homes to be pet friendly and would love to meet your pets.  After all, your pets will be jealous if you fail to include them in your fantasy adventure.

We are always looking for new ideas, suggestions and guidance regarding our existing properties and ideas for future worlds.  Your assistance is commendable.

We hope the experiences we've gained through our own travels will be felt in the spaces we create for our guests.

At Edifice, we algorithmically analyze and acquire foreclosures in qualified opportunity zones and develop those properties into vacation rentals that double as live-action guest experiences.  We work to reconceptualize residential real estate and the hotel industry, offering you the opportunity to book your own fantasy world.  Our primary goal is your satisfactory suspension of disbelief.  

We encourage you to raise the question:  why stay in a hotel room when I could otherwise rule from the pinnacles of King's Landing or Caesar's Palace, escape 1,000 leagues under the sea, wage my own wizard battle, establish a new dynasty at Pi-Ramesses, lead my lion pack into the Serengeti, cross swords with Hook in my pirate fortress, or cast down dragons in my own lair?  

I love great food and cocktails and am full of suggestions for fulfilling local experiences.  I also love animals.  I own cats and grew up with dogs.   I design my homes to be pet friendly and would love to meet your pets.  After all, your pets will be jealous if you fail to include them in your fantasy adventure.

We are always looking for new ideas, suggestions and guidance regarding our existing properties and ideas for future worlds.  Your assistance is commendable.

We understand that the true cost of a hotel includes the opportunity cost of your time and promise to work diligently to maximize your enjoyment from every second of your vacation adventure.
