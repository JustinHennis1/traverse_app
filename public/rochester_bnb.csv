We’re glad you’re here. 
We just wanted to share a little bit about ourselves.
We are from the Philippines, born and raised. 
Joelle and I have known each other since 3rd grade — for a short stint. 
We reconnected again by going to the same high school. 
After high school, we got disconnected when I went to the US and she went overseas to UAE.
In 2017, we officially started a long-distance relationship. 
We managed it well that we’re now together in the US since 2018. 
We also now have a son and his name is Jagger who is the joy of our lives.
If we’re not on a road trip, we’re flying somewhere to travel. 
We love to keep our minds and perspectives fresh by experiencing different cultures, food, and people. 
We may just be starting out our journey but we hope to replicate our experiences by being an instrument for you, your friends, and your families to create beautiful moments staying at our properties.
We’re thrilled to be here and we hope to host you soon.

These two sets of qualities hopefully make me someone who can help you find a relaxing and convenient place to stay at a price point that works for you. I'm a life-time Rochestarian working with a locally owned and operated small short-term rental start-up, and we're exploring different avenues for bringing our high-quality, well-maintained properties to the right people who will treat our homes like their own, even if just for a short period of time. We've gone above and beyond with our attention to detail in both the luxurious interior design, and the practicality and lived-in home feel necessary to feel comfortable in your short-term home away from home, If all of this sounds like a spiel, maybe it is. But the truth is, I want you to come and stay in our properties because I care about people, and I promise to show you that through our interactions, our communication, and our ability to provide you and your loved ones with a super comfortable place to live while you're here in my city, for whatever reason, and for however long you'd like.
